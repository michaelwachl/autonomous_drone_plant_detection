# Environmet Sensor Extension for Tello Drone 

## Overview

This is a [ROS] package used to listen on **Port 8080** to receive a UDP package from a another machine. In our case a 
[ESP8266 ESP-01S](https://www.az-delivery.de/products/esp8266-01), sends out UDP messages over a WiFi-connection
which contains the sensor measures. These measurements are then published as a ROS topic. This package provides nodes for 
the [BME680](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660) and [SCD30](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15112) sensors.

**BME680** provides measurements for:
* **temperature** in *C (float32)
* **pressure** in hPa (float32)
* **humidity** in % (float32)
* **gas_resistance** in kOhms (float32)
* **altitude** Approx. Altitude in m (float32)
* **iaq**	Air quality score 0 - 100 (uint8)


**SCD30** provides measurements for:
* **temperature** in *C (float32)
* **humidity** in % (float32)
* **co2** in PPM (uint16)


**Keywords:** BME680, SCD30, UDP, Socket Communication

## Installation

### Installation from Packages

To install all packages from the this repository as Debian packages use

    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-...

### Building from Source

#### Dependencies

- [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://wiki.ros.org) (middleware for robotics),
- [Eigen] (linear algebra library)

#### Further preparation
Make sure you allow UDP communication over port 8080 on your machine.

#### Building

To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using

	cd catkin_ws/src
	git clone https://github.com/michaelwachl/autonomous_drone_plant_detection.git
	cd ../
	catkin_make


## Usage
If no roscore is running, start one with 
    
    roscore

Then Run the sensor node(s) with

	rosrun environment_sensor bme680_receive.py
or

    rosrun environment_sensor bme680_receive.py
depending on your sensor.

## Config files

Config file folder/set 1

* **config_file_1.yaml** Shortly explain the content of this config file

Config file folder/set 2

* **...**

## Launch files

* **launch_file_1.launch:** shortly explain what is launched (e.g standard simulation, simulation with gdb,...)

     Argument set 1

     - **`argument_1`** Short description (e.g. as commented in launch file). Default: `default_value`.

    Argument set 2

    - **`...`**

* **...**

## Nodes

### scd30_node

Reads temperature measurements and computed the average.


#### Subscribed Topics

* **`/temperature`** ([sensor_msgs/Temperature])

	The temperature measurements from which the average is computed.


#### Published Topics

* **`/environment_sensor/scd30`** (environment_sensor.msg/SCD30)

#### Services

* **`get_average`** ([std_srvs/Trigger])

	Returns information about the current average. For example, you can trigger the computation from the console with

		rosservice call /ros_package_template/get_average


#### Parameters

* **`subscriber_topic`** (string, default: "/temperature")

	The name of the input topic.

* **`cache_size`** (int, default: 200, min: 0, max: 1000)

	The size of the cache.


### bme680_node

#### Subscribed Topics

This node listens on the **Port 8080** to receive UDP Packages from a microcontroller.

#### Published Topics

* **`/environment_sensor/bme680`** (environment_sensor.msg/BME680)
